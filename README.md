# Student-Management
This Python script utilizes the Tkinter library to create a simple Student Management System with SQLite database integration. The application allows users to input student details such as name, college, phone number, and address. Data is stored in an SQLite database, and the results can be displayed in a separate window.

To use the application:

1.Enter student details in the main window.

2.Click "Take input" to save the data to the SQLite database.

3.Click "Display result" to open a new window displaying a tree view of all stored student records.

Note: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed and a valid SQLite connection before running the script. Customize the database schema and UI elements as needed for your specific requirements.
